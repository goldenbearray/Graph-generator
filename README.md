# Graph-generator
This data generator is used to generate a set of graphs. 
The graph database is composed of a set of positive graphs and a set of negative graphs.
This code first generates a set of patterns. Then these patterns are approximately embedded in positive graphs and negative graphs. These patterns appear more frequently in the posive set to guarantee that they are discriminative.
